2013-2017	PhD in climate science: “Les nuages du Groenland observés par CALIPSO.” (Clouds over Greenland observed by CALIPSO)
	• Comparison of the cloud satellite observations with ground based observations taken at Summit station, Greenland (work realized during a 3 months internship at Boulder, USA).
	• Study of the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the Greenland clouds using active remote sensing instruments (CALIPSO).
• Study of the impact of the clouds on the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice-sheet.
	• Evaluation of the clouds and their surface radiative effect in CMIP5 climate models using the observation simulator COSP.

2013		Temporal variability of the aerosols chemical composition in the 
(6 months)	western Mediterranean sea during the Charmex field campaign			(Internship)
		• Chemical analysis.
• Preparation of the sampling material.
• Participation to the Charmex field campaign at the Cap Corse in France.
